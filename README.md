# Intro to Software Development

Welcome to the Intro to Software Development class offered by PACHEK! The
purpose of this class is to ignite a passion for making awesome things and learn
introductory level computer programming concepts along the way.

## For Parents

By the end of this course, your student **will** understand introductory level
computer programming concepts and know how to use those concepts to create basic
programs. While a lot of this course takes place over the web, we'll do our best
at staying on-topic and away from unsafe or inappropriate content. Students and
parents will have access to a private Slack instance to communicate with each
other about coursework and to get assistance from the instructor. Students will
be asked to create an account with GitLab to host their code projects. They will
be provided access to a private development environment that they can access
through their web browsers; they ___will not need to install any software___ on
their laptops, and they do not need any particular operating system--Mac,
Windows, and Linux will all be fine.

## For Students

Have you ever had a great idea for a new website, app, or computer program? If
so, then this is the class for you! You'll learn the basics of computer
programming as well as important tools and methodologies used by software
developers to make great products.

## Requirements

You will need a laptop that can connect to wifi and a web browser. That's it!

## Instructor

Richard Davis is a developer for Ramsey Solutions where he builds web apps that
train and equip financial coaches to change lives and fight the toxic money
culture in America. Prior to becoming a developer, Richard served in the US Army
Infantry, deploying twice to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring
Freedom.

## Learning Outcomes

Students will be able to:
* Perform filesystem tasks on a remote Linux server.
* Write and run a Ruby program/script from the commandline.
* Demonstrate understanding of computer programming concepts such as:
  * variable assignments,
  * datatypes,
  * control flow,
  * functions,
  * classes and other object-oriented concepts,
  * input/output,
  * and more.
* Use a version control system (git) to save progress.
* Collaborate with others through pair programming and mob programming.
* Manage tasks using a Kanban board.

## Course Policies

Students are expected to be courteous and respectful to each other and the
instructor in both the classroom and online environment. Students will remain
focused on the tasks set before them, and the instructor will ensure that the
environment is free of distractions. The environment will be highly 
collaborative and judgement-free; students should not be afraid to mess up or
ask for help.

## Course Schedule

### Week One

We will introduce ourselves to the class, learn what Kanban is, get familiarized
with the development environment, create GitLab accounts, and write our first
program.

### Week Two

We will learn about some of the basic data types in Ruby: numbers and strings.

### Week Three

We will learn how to store Ruby objects in collections (arrays and hashes), as
well as how we can interact with those collections.

### Week Four

We will learn how to handle conditional and repetitive logic.

### Week Five

We will work in pairs to create a script that will require using everything that
we have learned up to this point.

### Week Six

We will learn how to organize our code into methods, modules, and classes.

### Week Seven

We will learn about object-oriented concepts such as encapsulation, abstraction,
inheritance, and polymorphism.

### Week Eight

We will continue to learn about the object-oriented concepts that were
introduced in the previous week. Also, we will discuss what the next steps are
for continuing our journey as young software developers.
