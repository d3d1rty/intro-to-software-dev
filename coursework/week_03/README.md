# Week Three
This week is all about collections: arrays and hashes.

Arrays are collections that hold an ordered list of objects. To reference an object within an array, you use an integer which reflects that object's
position within the order of objects in the array. You can add objects to an array, take objects out of an array, determine the length of an array
and more.

Hashes are also collections, but unlike arrays, the objects stored within are key-value pairs. To reference an object within a hash, you use the
key that corresponds to the object you are trying to access. Similar to arrays, you can add objects to a hash, take objects out, and much more.

## Exercises
Work through each of the exercises changing the expectations so that they pass. As you progress through them, you can open up a REPL to test
something out or look up more information in the official documentation. You are encouraged to do both. After completing all of the exercises,
move on to the assignment.

## Assignment
Write a program that prompts a user for a string. It should then perform several different functions on that user-provided string and print them
to the screen:
* Print the string reversed and in all caps.
* Display the length of the string.
* Tell whether the string starts or ends with a vowel.

Write a program that prompts the user for a temperature in Farenheit. It should then convert that temperature to Celsius and display it to the
screen. The conversion for Farenheit to Celsius is: (5/9) * (X - 32).
