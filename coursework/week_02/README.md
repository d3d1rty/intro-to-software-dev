# Week Two
This week is all about strings and numbers.

Strings are sequences of characters that can be letters or numbers. Try thinking about strings like sentences:
sentences can have letters, numbers, spaces, punctuation marks, and other special characters; so can strings. We use strings in programming
to represent text.

Numbers can be broken into two different types: integers and floats. Simply put: an integer is a whole number, while a float is a number
with a fractional component.

You'll find that most of the programming that you do will extensively use these data types, so we'll start our deep dive into programming
with Ruby by examining each of these.

## Exercises
Work through each of the exercises changing the expectations so that they pass. As you progress through them, you can open up a REPL to test
something out or look up more information in the official documentation. You are encouraged to do both. After completing all of the exercises,
move on to the assignment.

## Assignment
Write a program that prompts a user for a string. It should then perform several different functions on that user-provided string and print them
to the screen:
* Print the string reversed and in all caps.
* Display the length of the string.
* Tell whether the string starts or ends with a vowel.

Write a program that prompts the user for a temperature in Farenheit. It should then convert that temperature to Celsius and display it to the
screen. The conversion for Farenheit to Celsius is: (5/9) * (X - 32).
