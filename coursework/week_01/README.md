# Week One
For the first week, we'll spend most of our time getting oriented to the course and our workspaces. Also, we'll create our first computer program.

## Exercises
You'll be executing a lot of commands from the command-line while in this course. These commands will let you navigate around the
filesystem, find out information about files, run specialized programs to accomplish tasks, and more. Here are a few that you will
find useful:

`cd`: Change the current working directory. Ex. `cd coursework/week_one/`

`pwd`: List the path for the current working directory.

`ls`: List the files in a given directory

`ls -la`: List the files in a given directory with additional details provided.

`mkdir`: Makes a directory. Ex. `mkdir my-folder/`

`touch`: Makes a file. Ex. `touch my-file.txt`

`rm`: Removes a file. Ex. `rm my-file.txt`

`rm -rf`: Removes a directory. Ex. `rm -rf my-folder/`

`cp`: Copies a file. Ex. `cp my-file.txt my-file.txt.bak`

`mv`: Moves a file. Ex. `mv my-file.txt my-folder/`

These commands are some of the most basic ways to move around in a Unix-based system like Linux or Mac. Explore your workspace;
try creating some files and directories, copying and moving files between directories, navigating between directories, and removing
stuff. Get familiarized and comfortable as we will be spending a lot of time in the commandline.


## Assignment
Create a file called `hello_world.rb` and add the following line of code into it, then save the file:

```
puts 'Hello, World!'
```

The "Hello, World!" program is the first program that all computer programmers write. It's sort of a tradition.

Now, run the program by executing command: `ruby hello_world.rb`

What happens?
